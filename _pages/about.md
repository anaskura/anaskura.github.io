I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Donostia International Physics Center](https://dipc.ehu.eus/en) in San Sebastian, Spain. I received my PhD in theoretical condensed matter physics from the [University of Zurich](https://www.uzh.ch/en.html) in 2022. 

In my research, I study electronic properties of quantum matter originating from an interplay between symmetries and correlations of their constituents. My research interests lie in the field of topological phases, unconventional superconductivity, low-dimentional correlated materials, their experimental signatures and potential device applications.
