title: "Robust spin polarization of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states in superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator heterostructures"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-15-ysr
excerpt: 'Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are subgap bound states of a magnetic impurity in a superconducting host. Usually magnetic impurities in such systems are modelled as classical spins. However, a wide selection of magnetic adatoms and substrates show experimental signatures, which are not adequately captured by such approach and require quantum treatment of impurity spin. In this work we take into account the quantum nature of the impurity spin in a single-site approximation to study a system of magnetic impurity in a spin-split superconductor, i.e., a superconductor in proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator. We investigate the spectral properties of the single-particle excitations and compare the results of this quantum approach to the classical approach, which conventionally predicts fully polarized YSR excitations even in the absence of exchange and external magnetic field.'

Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states are subgap bound states of a magnetic impurity in a superconducting host. Usually magnetic impurities in such systems are modelled as classical spins. However, a wide selection of magnetic adatoms and substrates show experimental signatures, which are not adequately captured by such approach and require quantum treatment of impurity spin. In this work we take into account the quantum nature of the impurity spin in a single-site approximation to study a system of magnetic impurity in a spin-split superconductor, i.e., a superconductor in proximity to a ferromagnetic insulator. We investigate the spectral properties of the single-particle excitations and compare the results of this quantum approach to the classical approach, which conventionally predicts fully polarized YSR excitations even in the absence of exchange and external magnetic field.
