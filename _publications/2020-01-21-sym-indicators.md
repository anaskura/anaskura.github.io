title: "Atomic limit and inversion-symmetry indicators for topological superconductors"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2020-01-21-sym-indicators
excerpt: 'Symmetry indicators allow to identify topological crystalline insulators using symmetry-group analysis of their Bloch states. An extension of this approach to superconducting systems requires defining an appropriate atomic limit for superconductors. Here, we introduce such a notion of atomic limit and derive a symmetry indicator for inversion-symmetric superconductors. This indicator allows for a refined topological classification including higher-order phases for systems in the superconducting phase with and without time-reversal symmetry. We further elucidate their bulk-boundary correspondence using Dirac surface theories. This indicator is well suited for a search of topological superconductors using first-principles calculations.

Symmetry indicators allow to identify topological crystalline insulators using symmetry-group analysis of their Bloch states. An extension of this approach to superconducting systems requires defining an appropriate atomic limit for superconductors.

This indicator allows for a refined topological classification including higher-order phases for systems in the superconducting phase with and without time-reversal symmetry. We further elucidate their bulk-boundary correspondence using Dirac surface theories. This indicator is well suited for a search of topological superconductors using first-principles calculations.
